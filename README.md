# Inn

```
Because all journeys begin with the party meeting in an inn
```

This is a clone of Kooth's sign up micro frontend, for use in pairing interviews.

It was chosen because:

- It's a good introduction to what we do, who our customers are and to who uses our products
- It's small enough that the dependencies and tests install/run quickly
- There is enough logic that it can be extended in interesting ways
- There's some room for refactoring and improvement

Some notes:

- The CI set up and docker stuff has been removed.
- The config for local development is in `./parcel.js`, in case changing it comes up.
- This clone is as of last year. Our code is much better now.

### Setup

`npm install`

### Tests

`npm run test`

### Local development

`npm run start`

### Feature Request

For this interview, we've received a request for a new feature to add to this codebase.
We're going to work through implementing it together: feel free to ask us for any context or direction within the codebase!
Don't worry too much about finishing within the hour, we're more interested in seeing how you approach problems and code solutions
