# Inn

```
Becausue all journeys begin with the party meeting in an inn
```

This is a clone of one of the XenZone sign up 'micro' frontends for use in pairing interviews.

It was chosen because:

- It's a good introduction to what we do, who our customers are and to who uses our products
- It's small enough that the dependencies and tests install/run quickly
- There is enough logic that it can be extended in interesting ways
- There's some room for refactoring and improvement

### Setup

`npm install`

### Tests

`npm run test`

### Local development

`npm run start`

## Interview Task

Add a new question to the sign up form so that users signing up in Wales are asked for the area of Wales they are from.

The list of areas is:
- North Wales
- Dyfed Powys
- South Wales
- Gwent
