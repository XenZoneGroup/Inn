# Inn

```
Becausue all journeys begin with the party meeting in an inn
```

This is a clone of one of the XenZone sign up 'micro' frontends for use in pairing interviews.

It was chosen because:

- It's a good introduction to what we do, who our customers are and to who uses our products
- It's small enough that the dependencies and tests install/run quickly
- There is enough logic that it can be extended in interesting ways
- There's some room for refactoring and improvement

### Setup

`npm install`

### Tests

`npm run test`

### Local development

`npm run start`
